# Exports
# By defining exports here, they will be active regardless of how the term
# instance is started.

# NOTE:
# .bash_profile is executed for login shells (ie. SSH), while .bashrc is
# executed for non-login, interactive shells.
#
# If you are looking to set variables or other settings that are available
# in any terminal instance, placing them here, or in .bashrc is the better
# bet. .bash_profile will call .bashrc upon login, and .bashrc (which
# calls this file) will be called if a new terminal instance is opened.
#

# GLOBAL VARIABLES:
# To set global export variables, add them to /etc/profile or add a script
# to /etc/profile.d/ directory.
